# Module 8: Optimizations (Frustum Culling)
This module demonstrates culling objects from the scene when they fall outside the view frustum. The module has a visible frustum (not attached to the camera). Objects that fall within this frustum are colored blue, whereas objects that fall oustide the frustum are colored red. Pressing the 'r' key will toggle this frustum rotating. Furthermore, the camera's frustum culls objects from the scene. Objects that do not fall within the camera frustum are not rendered. Pressing the 'l' key will list (in the command prompt) all objects that are within the camera frustum.
